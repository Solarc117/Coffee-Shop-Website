test & fix css browser compatibility:
  ✅ edge
  ✅ firefox
  ❌ safari (annoying T_T, i'll assume compatibility w/firefox for now)
test & fix js browser compatibility:
  ✅ edge (background images caching)
  ✅ firefox (background images don't cache T_T)
    ❌ precache images for different pages individually (use different globalThis properties), then set dynamic background interval afterward?
      ❌ for about.js, prerender all about images in globalThis.aboutImages
      ❌ then set dynamic background, iterating through globalThis.aboutImages rather than a local array of image urls
        ❌ this would require modifying the preloadImages function so images are not removed from the array once they are loaded, which is what the original function was designed to do, for memory consumption reasons. Let me try it, but I am aware that this is probably a bad idea.
      - set two divs with alternating background images, to allow images to render, then change the opacity of one to 0 and the other to 1?
        ✅ create a new div, called background_image, in about
        ✅ set its background to red to position correctly
        ✅ set width & height to 100%, w/o messing w/page layout
        ✅ figure out how to synchronize both div & body background image changes, & opacity changes
          I'll set the interval to alternate btw changing div & body images, & will set a timeout of ~50ms to then change the opacity of the div.
        ✅ if count is even, set body's background to next image, & set timeout of 50ms to remove class opaque to div
        ✅ if count is odd, set div's background to next image, & set timeout of 50ms to add class opaque to div
        ✅ write fade_in & fade_out keyframes (opacity 0 to 1 & 1 to 0, respectively)
        - link .background_image.opaque to fade_in, & .background_image to fade_in in global.css
  ❌ safari (see note above)
✅ write html & css for store hours snippet (no js yet):
  ✅ write circle pulsing animation:
  ✅ fill the circle ambiguously by default
NOTE: I could use setTimeout to schedule the store hours cache clearer at 00:00 MDT (07:00 UTC).
write code to render/mutate circle color & text depending on the time:
  in global.js, see if an iframe with the google embed api can be created w/o displaying it to the user - purely for the sake of api calls; check for successful api calls in:
    ✅ home page 
    ✅ about page
    ✅ contact page 
  ✅ in the daily cache cleaner, check if it is an MDT Sunday and at least 24hrs have passed since the last local fetch, OR if there are no store hours in the local storeHours key.
    I am aware that the user could delete their local data, thus forcing another api call. Won't fix right now, but will keep in mind.
  ✅ if either condition above is true, set the localStorage storeHours property to the response of a new API call.
  verify/debug functionality so far:
    ✅ log condition that causes api to fetch   
    ✅ find a way to use the built-in isOpen function, or write one
  ✅ check if isOpen works under localStorage or a global variable
  write html & css for .hours_snippet:
    ✅ revert grid template back to what it was & use position: absolute on .store_hours
    ✅ change the last column's width to be 250px
    ✅ align nav links to the left of the last grid column
    ✅ set store_hours to occupy the entire last column
    ✅ verify correct placement when displaying/hiding nav
    ✅ add animation to show/hide store_hours
    ✅ verify correct placement of store_hours & nav:
  ✅ set the default fill of the store_circle to white, & set the default text content to recommending the customer call the store or check google for up-to-date hours
  ✅ set store_hours tabindex to -1 when it does NOT have the class "show" 
  ✅ use the placeDetailsResult.opening_hours.isOpen method to pass a boolean to updateStoreHours, & the store hours array if api fetch successful
  - if open: 
    ✅ add an "open" class to snippet_circle
    ✅ remove no_display class from svg
    ✅ create the following tag:
      <p>Open -&nbsp;
        <a class="open_text link">Business Hours</a>
      </p>
    ✅ change open_text's innerHTML to the created p tag
      Add tbody w/store hours to .store_hours.
  ✅ if closed, add a "closed" class to snippet_circle & change open_text's textContent to "Closed" 
  ✅ if neither, add 'no_display' class to #snippet_svg, & append default values to snippet & store_hours (or use no_display)
✅ verify that store hours are fetched IF lastFetchDate was a week ago, or longer
✅ set snippet width to auto, or fix gap another way
✅ expand store hours div smoothly to show store hours on click/tap
✅ horizontal XIN CHAO in mobile, smaller font size
✅ Hey Carlos, I think we should need a footer for the page

✅ ***ERROR*** circle svg is not visible in firefox
  add cx, cy & fill properties to the svg itself
✅ ***ERROR*** store_hours & circle are not displayed when moving from one page to another
✅ placeDetailsResult is undefined when switching from one page to another 
  ✅ only fetch store hours from Google, store lastFetchDate, & write own function using Intl & google's store hours to check if the store is open
    ✅ get current MT weekday, hour & minutes (from anywhere):
      ✅ use Intl's DateTimeFormat method, 'America/Edmonton' zone & weekday, hours & minutes properties to get current MT weekday, hour & minutes
    ✅ get close/open hrs for appropriate weekday (from localStorage):
      ✅ iterate through localStorage's week_day hours array, until a string is found that matches the weekday word from the Date/Intl API
    ✅ compare hours to determine store state:
      ✅ convert opening & closing hours to numeric, 24-format hours & minutes

✅ add normalize to html files
test & fix css browser compatibility:
  ✅ edge
  ✅ firefox
  ❌ safari (annoying T_T, i'll assume compatibility w/firefox for now)
test & fix js browser compatibility:
  ✅ edge (background images caching)
  ✅ firefox (background images don't cache T_T)
    ❌ precache images for different pages individually (use different globalThis properties), then set dynamic background interval afterward?
      ❌ for about.js, prerender all about images in globalThis.aboutImages
      ❌ then set dynamic background, iterating through globalThis.aboutImages rather than a local array of image urls
        ❌ this would require modifying the preloadImages function so images are not removed from the array once they are loaded, which is what the original function was designed to do, for memory consumption reasons. Let me try it, but I am aware that this is probably a bad idea.
      - set two divs with alternating background images, to allow images to render, then change the opacity of one to 0 and the other to 1?
        ✅ create a new div, called background_image, in about
        ✅ set its background to red to position correctly
        ✅ set width & height to 100%, w/o messing w/page layout
        ✅ figure out how to synchronize both div & body background image changes, & opacity changes
          I'll set the interval to alternate btw changing div & body images, & will set a timeout of ~50ms to then change the opacity of the div.
        ✅ if count is even, set body's background to next image, & set timeout of 50ms to remove class opaque to div
        ✅ if count is odd, set div's background to next image, & set timeout of 50ms to add class opaque to div
        ✅ write fade_in & fade_out keyframes (opacity 0 to 1 & 1 to 0, respectively)
        - link .background_image.opaque to fade_in, & .background_image to fade_in in global.css
    
  ❌ safari (see note above)

- write html & css (no js yet)

- make nav_links height 100% when in mobile

ðŸŽ¯ objective for today: finish the editable product component

- create a simplified version, with only the default html and no functionality:
  -  render out a single editable product component after fetching menu, to see the missing parts/errors

- style editable component

- add an event listener to the save button

- make an update request in the event listener, and alert the user of the result

- test to ensure component does update the db



- render a quantitypricepair by default (set default values to the first quantity and price in the quantityprices array, if they exist, and undefined (none) if not) inside editable product

- render out a QuantityPricePair for every key in price (set the array that we map through to generate quantitypricepairs to a length of 0 if price is a string)

- create an editable product component:
  - create initial html:
    - if price is an Object instance, map through its elements, skipping the first element and rendering an fieldset.additional_pair in .quantity_prices_fieldset

Admin component functionality:
- create an authorized stateful variable, defaulting to false
- on initial render:
  - make a request to the verify endpoint
  - if the request returns a status of 200, set the authorized stateful variable to true
  - whenever the form is submitted, make a request to the auth endpoint, and set the authorized stateful variable to true

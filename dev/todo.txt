✅ add background images in home component (rotate btw 2 divs):
  ✅ rotate 1 div between 3 images
  ✅ rotate second div between image ahead of current image
  ✅ initialize a boolean firstDivOpaque value
  ✅ add 'opaque' class to first div if val above true, & opposite for second div
  ✅ after updating imageindex, update firstDivOpaque after 750ms 
  ✅ store second image index in a stateful value as well
  ✅ use second image index for second div
  ✅ increment imageIndex by steps of 2 instead of 1
  ✅ find zindex required to pop background image 2 above background image 1, but still behind everything else (-1 and 0 maybe?)
  ✅ extract main into different components, to style differently (.contact_main, .home_main, etc.)

        <b>Our Story</b>
      </i>
      <br />
      <br />
      Being Vietnamese people, we take pride in our culture, cuisine, and
      identity. Our coffee has affirmed a reputation in the global market; our
      brewing methods result in a uniquely fragrant and strong coffee flavour.
      Grabbing a cup of coffee at the street vendor is a daily routine for many
      Vietnamese people, and a significant part of our identity.
      <br />
      <br />
      We observed the difficulty for the Vietnamese community in Calgary to
      enjoy authentic Vietnamese coffee, and embraced a vision to launch the
      first Vietnamese coffee shop in Calgary. Instead of solely offering unique
      coffee, we hope to also bring our cultural beauty; the interior is
      carefully designed to blend western modern architecture with Vietnamese
      architecture, and we pour our heart and soul into each drink. We look
      forward to meeting you!

      <br />
      Since <span class='brand_name'> Xin ChÃ o</span> is the first shop that
      serves a traditional, unique Vietnamese coffee taste in Calgary, we looked
      for a Vietnamese word that conveys our enthusiasm over this exciting new
      opening. "Xin chÃ o" means "hello" in English, and is convenient for
      non-Vietnamese people to pronuounce. So
      <span class='brand_name'>"Xin ChÃ o Coffee"</span> is our way of saying
      <span class='brand_name'>"Hello!"</span> to our new, current, and future
      customers ðŸ˜Š
